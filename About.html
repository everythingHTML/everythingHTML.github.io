                    everythingHTML is a page designed to be a place where people can learn HTML and CSS
                    with easy to understand explenations and step-by-step tutorials. We aim to make the
                    entire learning process of HTML as easy as possible, so that even people with no
                    experience at all in programming can start with it.

                    We also aim to keep this website open-source and without advertisements or any sort
                    of payments since we believe that knowledge should be free and available for everyone!

                As for now, since this website is still in development, and we are a VERY little team
                (currently 2 people), our only plans for the future is to constantly add content to this
                page and to improve/fix any bugs. As we already said though, we are a very small team,
                meaning, that the development of this website is a bit slow, but we do everything we can
                to add more content and build this site up as fast as possible.

                Hi, my name is Matthias, I am from Germany, currently 17 years old and as of now a student
                in the 11th grade. I created this project for everyone, who would like to get into
                programming, but are afraid of explenations that are really created for already
                experienced programmers, or do not know where to start when learning a programming language.
            </p>
            <p>
                I remember when I was starting to get into the world, no, universe of programming and was
                totally lost between random stackoverflow questions and w3schools chapters. Back then all
                I whished for was an easy to understand, clear website, which explained me everything I
                needed in order to start with programming. Because HTML is one of the easiest, yet still
                very versatile programming languages, I had the idea to just use my own knowledge I collected
                until now and create exactly this one website, that contains everything I need to know in an
                easy to understand format, by myself, so that other people have it easier to start with it.
