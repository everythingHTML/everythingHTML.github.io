    <div class="Headline">
      <h1>Introduction</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="MainTextWide">
      <p>
        So since we really want to totally start from scrap and this is also the introduction
        here are some things to consider first before starting with coding:</p>
    </div>
    <div class="List">
        <ul>
          <li><p><b id="BoldHeading">It won't be something that will be done in a couple of hours!</b>
              <br/>Creating an entire website will take months, if you are working on it very quickly and on a daily basis</p>

          <li><p><b id="BoldHeading">Learning a programming language is as hard as learning a "real" language!</b>
              <br/>You will need to remember a lot of "vocabs", key terms basically, for example what <span style="font-family:mono-space">&lt;div&gt;</span>
              means and how it is being used. There is also a sort of grammar for programming languages called syntax which might also take some time to get
              used to, but as with everything, as soon as you know and understand all of that learning html will be a breeze!</p>

          <li><p><b id="BoldHeading">Expect to run into some bugs and glitches (Happens to everyone!)</b><br/>
            Every programmer or developer has to deal with bugs and glitches since they are just omnipresent, so don't be afraid of telling anyone if you have
            to deal with a bug or something else. Even whilst we created this website we ran into some bugs and the fun thing about programming is the feel
            that you are playing a puzzle games sometimes when you have to find that one line that causes that bug.</p>

          <li><p><b id="BoldHeading">Prepare yourself and your fingers for a lot of typing!</b><br/>
            Since you will be writing multiple text files with each easily being able to reach over 500 to sometimes even 1000 lines (yep, that happens if
            you only use one css file and trust me, it really gets messy!), you should be prepared. In order to prevent your fingers from becoming numb or starting to ache,
            get a good keyboard. I personally recommend mechanical keyboards since they don't cause so much pain as mushy membrane keyboards and they have the nice tactile
            feeling of an old type writer with the only downside being, that they are also as loud as old type writers (but there are silence kits, so no worries). Also you
            might want to have a look at and learn some ways to stretch and flex your fingers whilst taking breaks.</p>

          <li><p><b id="BoldHeading">TAKE BREAKS!!!</b><br>
            Rome wasn't built in a day, so neither do you have to program an entire website in one day or a couple of hours. Take your time and take breaks. Work at a pace that
            suits you and doesn't feel like it is sucking your life energy out of you.

    <div class="Headline">
      <h1>Programs</h1>
    </div>

    <div class="MainTextWide">
      <p>In order to start with programming in HTML, you will have to have some programs to start coding and know how you can actually make your website visible for everyone:</p>
    </div>

    <div class="List">
      <ul>
        <li><p><b id="BoldHeading">Text editor: Atom</b>
            <br/>Atom is a very powerful and customizeable text editor and comes with many useful features right out of the box, one of them being, that it works almost neatlessly with GitHub Desktop.
                  During all tutorials, we will always be using Atom as our text editor.
                  <br/><b>Atom is available for Windows, Mac and Linux! Download it here:</p>
      </ul>
      <div class="Button">
        <a href="https://atom.io/" class="Link">Atom Text Editor</b></a>
      </div>
      <ul>
        <li><p><b id="BoldHeading">Cloud platform and website publishing: GitHub Desktop</b><br/>
            Of course we will need to publish the website and also save all the files at a save place in order for them to not get lost. Since there is a place where you can join those, normally quite
            difficult tasks, with ease, we chose to use GitHub. It offers cloud storage, collaborative work on projects of any kind and any programming language, <b>it is totally free</b>, and finally,
            it also allows you to publish your website very easily. This website is actually running via GitHub and it already proved itself to be a very good choice!.
            <br/><b style="color: #E77C00;">Please note, that you need an account for GitHub in order to use it and save all your files!</b>
            <br/><b>GitHub Desktop is available for Mac and Windows, for Linux, we advice GitKraken! Download them here:</p>
      </ul>
      <div class="Button2">
        <div class="HorizontalButtons"><a href="https://desktop.github.com/" class="Link">GitHub Desktop</a></div>
        <div class="HorizontalButtons"><a href="https://www.gitkraken.com/" class="Link">GitKraken</b></a></div>

    <div class="MainTextWide">
      <p>That is all you need to start off with programming. During our different tutorial chapters we will also further explain those programs in detail and show you how to use them!</p>
