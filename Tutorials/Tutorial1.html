      <h3>What is HTML?</h3>
      HTML is one of the most commonly used languages when creating websites, because all web browsers can understand it. There are different versions of HTML, but currently the most commonly used is HTML5 so we will also be using it. HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language.
    </p>
    <p>
      <h3>What is a web browser?</h3>
      A web browser is a software used for searching information on the world wide web, for example the most common ones are Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Safari and Firefox. A useful command when programming HTML is [ctrl u] on windows, or [alt cmd u] on mac will give a separate tab displaying, how that particular website looks in HTML format. Some websites are generated using any kind of graphical editors which then make the code look very confusing and like it is written without any spaces since it was created by a computer.

      <h3>What are Tags?</h3>
    </p>
    <p>
      The next part of this tutorial is about tags. Tags are one of the most important parts in your website. They are basically commands telling the browser what to display on your screen and how. There are opening tags and closing tags, of which one is telling the browser where to start and the other where to end. For an opening tag to work it needs the less than (<) and greater than (>) symbols with the tag name in between them, whilst a closing tag needs the same components, but with a forward slash (/) after the <.
    </p>
    <p>
      Example
    </P>
    <P>
      <[Tag Name Here]>Content</[Tag Name Here>
    </p>
    <p>
      When you are writing your website it helps to use a bullet point like structure instead of in a single line, because it will be much easier to navigate when programming.

      Additionally you should create a new folder, where you are going to save all your documents, which will also help you be organised. The file in which you have written the code for the website must be saved with the ending [.html]. To open your website right click on it and open with a browser of your choice, or with atom to edit. Finally remember to save any edits you make, otherwise the changes will not show on the browser.
